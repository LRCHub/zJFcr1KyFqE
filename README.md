[00:05.75] I remember when we broke up the first time
[00:08.52] Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
[00:10.52] 'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
[00:13.48] When you said you needed space
[00:16.19] What?
[00:18.69] 
[00:17.01] Then you come around again and say
[00:18.93] "Baby, I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
[00:22.46] Remember how that lasted for a day?
[00:24.96] I say, "I hate you", we break up, you call me, "I love you"
[00:54.46] 
[00:28.29] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:30.62] We called it off again last night but
[00:33.48] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[00:36.49] This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[00:57.99] 
[00:39.36] We are never, ever, ever getting back together
[00:44.93] We are never, ever, ever getting back together
[00:50.33] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
[00:55.54] But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
[01:03.47] Like, ever
[01:08.47] 
[01:06.95] I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
[01:09.29] And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
[01:12.08] And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
[01:14.84] With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
[01:40.34] 
[01:18.16] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[01:21.00] You called me up again tonight but
[01:23.87] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[01:26.68] This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[01:48.18] 
[01:29.51] We (we) are never, ever, ever getting back together
[01:34.97] We are never, ever, ever getting back together
[01:40.50] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
[01:45.75] But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
[02:13.75] 
[01:52.14] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah!)
[01:54.75] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah!)
[01:57.27] Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah!)
[02:00.47] Oh-oh-oh!
[02:04.97] 
[02:03.34] I used to think that we were forever, ever
[02:08.37] And I used to say, never say never
[02:14.47] Pfft, so he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you"
[02:17.68] And I'm like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting
[02:20.93] You know, like we are never getting back together
[02:23.53] Like, ever (no!)
[02:31.53] 
[02:25.18] We are never, ever, ever getting back together
[02:31.06] We are never, ever, ever getting back together
[02:36.42] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
[02:41.98] But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
[03:09.98] 
[02:47.82] We (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[02:51.46] Getting back together
[02:53.20] We (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), oh
[02:57.07] Getting back together
[02:59.03] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
[03:04.66] But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
